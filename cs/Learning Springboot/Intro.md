 - monolithic application provides numerous capabilities makes sense when
	 - domain and scope is unknown
	 - capabilities are tightly coupled / absolute performance of module interactions take precedence over flexibility
	 - scaling requirements for capabilities are known and consistent
	 - functionality isn't volatile and change is slow
### REST
 - representational state transfer
	 - each service maintain its own state, even within a sequence of transactions
 - rest api
	 - number of standardized http verbs within a handful of rfcs
	 - consistently used in building APis
	 - POST / GET / PUT / PATCH / DELETE
	 - OPTIONS / HEAD also exist
