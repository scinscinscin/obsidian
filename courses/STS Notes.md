		 - Rejects the context of discovery
		 - Asserts that facts are not always observable, and that facts are neutral and objective
		 - Theories are confirmed, not proven, yet every instance that lends support corroborates the theory
	 - Inductive logic - specific facts to generalization
		 - Proposes and rests on a common understanding of the laws of the universe, there are laws of natures / uniformities that govern these laws

			 - No specific number of confirmations will make any hypothesis true
		 - A body of science must be falsifiable
		 - The notion of scientific progress for the falsicficationist rests on the premise that scientific theorists are tentative.
