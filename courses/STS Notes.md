Dark side of tech
 - Tech is a positive endeavor except for troubling possibilities referred to as wildcards by Michio Kaku. Unanticipated uses of technology and science can turn happy dreams into nightmares.

Philosophy
 - love of wisdom, literally the translation of philo and sophos
 -  Axiology
	 - Study of values in human behavior / study of moral problems
	 - the rightness and wrongness of actions / what is good and desirable
	 - Ethics - Study of human conduct and moral values
	 - Aesthetics - values beauty, nature, and aesthetic experience
 - Epistemological
	 - Study of knowledge, how we acquire knowledge and the types of limits there are to our knowledge. How do we know what is true?
	 - Deductive logic - general to specific
		 - Rejects the context of discovery
		 - Asserts that facts are not always observable, and that facts are neutral and objective
		 - Theories are confirmed, not proven, yet every instance that lends support corroborates the theory
	 - Inductive logic - specific facts to generalization
		 - Proposes and rests on a common understanding of the laws of the universe, there are laws of natures / uniformities that govern these laws
		 - Facts are observable, and that theories should be derived from these facts by observation. (Observation using the senses; seeing is believing)
	 - Falsificationism
		 - Rejects the context of discovery
		 - Confirmation of hypothesis is not enough
			 - No specific number of confirmations will make any hypothesis true
		 - A body of science must be falsifiable
		 - The notion of scientific progress for the falsicficationist rests on the premise that scientific theorists are tentative.
	 - Science must conitnue to progress through an open quest to put existing theories to the test, allowing preconceived notion of facts, whatever they may be, up to scientific criticism and refutation
 - Metaphysical
	 - The study of what is real
	 - Ontology: What is the nature of existence
	 - Cosmology: Origin of the universe

**Scientific method**
 - problem - ask a question
 - research - define problem statement
 - hypothesize - construct hypothesis
 - experiment - test the hypothesis
	 - Reliability - how consistent a method measures something. If the same result can be consistently, then the measure is considered reliable
		 - A reliable measurement is not always valid, just because they're reproducible doesn't make them correct
	 - Validity - how accurate a method measures what it is intended to measure
		 - Checks how well results correspond to established theories and other measures of the same concept
		 - High validity - produces results that correspond to real properties / characteristics
		 - Generally reliable - if a test produces accurate results they should be reproducible
 - analyze - collect data
	 - Quantitative data - numeric variables
		 - statistics turn this into useful information crucial for decision making. Scientifically objective and rational.
	 - Qualitative data - categorial variables
		 - deep understanding of how people perceive their social realities, and in consequence how they act within the social world
 - interpret - report the result
