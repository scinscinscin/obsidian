# Abstract Window Toolkit

 - The package in the java API that allows us to create graphical user interface objects like buttons, frames, textareas and the like
 - Superseded by the swing and JavaFX APIs
 - Components
	 - Buttons
	 - Textfields
	 - Label
 - Containers
	 - Panel
		 - A type of container that provides a space
		 - It cannot be launched itself, it needs to exist inside another container
	 - Frame
		 - Frame Class
			 - A top level window with a border and title bar
			 - Uses BorderLayout as the default layout manager
			 - Has resizable corners
	 - Dialog
 - Layout Managers
	 - Are used to position components inside containers
	 - can be customized by nesting containers
	 - From java.awt
		 - FlowLayout
			 - arranges components in a directional flow, like lines of text
			 - used to arrange buttons in a panel, arranging them horizontally until no more buttons fit on the same line
			 - the line arrangement is determined by the align property
				 - LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER, LEADING, TRAILING
		 - BorderLayout
			 - lays out a container, and resizing components to fit in five regions, NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, CENTER
			 - Each region can't contain more than 1 component
			 - `(new Panel()).add(new Button("okey"), BorderLayout.SOUTH)`
		 - GridLayout
			 - lays out a container's components in a rectangular grid
			 - container is decided into equal sized rectangles, and one component is placed in each rectangle, such that all components will still be equally sized
		 - Cardlayout
		 - GridBagLayout
	 - javax.swing
		 - BoxLayout
		 - SpringLayout

# Event Handling Techniques
 - **Events** - objects that describe interactions between the user and a gui component
 - **Event Sources** - GUI components that can be interacted with by the user
	 - have methods that allow you to register event listeners with them. When something happens to the source, it sends a notification to all the listener objects for that event
	 - All Information is encapsulated by an event object that is subclassed from `java.util.EventObject`
	 - Different event sources can produce different kinds of events
 - **Event handlers**
	 - a method that is invoked every time that an event is called
	 - where you put code that runs everytime an event occurs
 - Techniques
	 - Event delegation model
		 - Allows you to delegate the event handler to a different class, producing a loosely coupled GUI and Event handler package
			 - Each class is a separate Java source file
		 - Can attach as many event handlers to one event source, just need to register each one to the source
	 - Listeners - interfaces that you implement, you have to override all methods in the interface
	 - Adapter classes - like listeners, but you're not required to override everything
		 - only listeners that contain two or more methods have a corresponding adapter class
		 - they have default implementations for the listener so you don't have to override everything
	 - Inner classes
		 - make for tightly coupled components, used to group the UI and event handler code tightly in a single codebase
	 - Anonymous classes
		 - creates an object on the fly that is anonymous
		 - does not have any handler or object references
		 - they are automatically destroyed, leaving memory in an optimized state
			 - Are used usually for mobile devices / desktop applications that have an efficient runtime, since having less objects in memory improves runtime speed
	 - Lambda expression
		 - Allows you to pass unnamed functions as parameters to methods. 
		 - A simplified version of anonymous classes

# Swing
 - A part of the java foundation classes that is used to create window-based applications
 - Built on top of AWT, but provides a set of platform independent and lightweight components
	 - Swing is platform independent, AWT is platform dependent
	 - Swing is lightweight, AWT is heavyweight
	 - Swing look and feel can be customized, AWT cannot be customized
	 - Swing provides mower powerful components, AWT provides less components
	 - Swing follows MVC pattern, AWT does not
 - `javax.swing` provides classes for the swing API:
	 - JRadioButton - Implementation of a radiobutton, can be selected / deselected
		 - Can be used in collaboration with a ButtonGroup to group buttons, so that only one can be selected in the group at a timer
	 - JCheckbox - Implementation of a checkbox, an item that can be selected or deselected
		 - Any number of checkbox in a group can be selected, and is toggleable by a click
	 - JComboBox - a component that combines a button or editable field and a dropdown list
		 - the user can select a value from the drop down list, which is then set as the default view, similar to `<select />`
		 - If editable, the user can set their own values for it
	 - JList - a component that displays a list of values, where the user can select one or more items
		 - A separate model (ListModel) maintains the contents of the list, which must be created first before the JList itself
	 - JButton
	 - JTextField
	 - JTextArea
	 - JMenu
	 - JColorChooser
 - Converting from AWT to Swing
	 - Add a package declaration at the top of the source code so it can be packaged in a jar file
	 - Add J in front of the components and containers, but don't add it in the layout managers
 - JAR file - Java Archive
	 - A package file format typically used to group java classes into one file for distribution
	 - Can be accessed and used in different operating systems
	 - Without a manifest file: 
		 - Creating: `jar cvf <JarFile.jar> <list of files follows>`
		 - Running: `java -cp <JarFile.jar> <package.name.class.with.Main>`
	 - With manifest: 
		 - Creating: `jar cvfm <JarFile.jar> <Manifest.MF> <list of files follows>`
			 - where Manifest.MF contains: `Main-Class: <package.name.class.with.Main>`
		 - Running: `java -jar <JarFile.jar>`
