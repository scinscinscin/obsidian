	2. **Finding the minimum and maximum points:**
		1. Take the first derivative: $$y' = 3x^2-6x$$and find the values of x where `y' = 0`. $$0 = x(3x-6)$$ $$x=0, 2$$
		2. Substituting `x=0` and `x=2` in the original equation yields the points **`(0, 2)`** and **`(2, -2)`**, which are maximum and minimum points respectively.
	3. **Finding the point of inflection**
		1. Take the 2nd derivative `y''` $$y' = 3x^2-6x$$ $$y'' = 6x-6$$ and find values of x where `y'' = 0` $$0=6x-6$$ thus $$x=1$$ Substituting `x=1` in `y` yields the point **`(1, 0)`** which is the **point of inflection**.
		   
		   
		   
2. $$y=x^3-12x+12$$

	2. **Finding the minimum and maximum points:**
	    Find the first derivative of `y`$$y'=3x^2-12$$and find values of x where `y=0` $$0=3x^2-12$$ $$12=3x^2$$ thus `x = +/- 2`. Substituting these values to the y yields the points **`(-2, 28)`** and **`(2, -4)`**,        which are the **maximum and minimum points** respectively
	    
	1. **Finding the point of inflection:**
	    Take the second derivative of y $$y'=3x^2-12$$ $$y'' = 6x$$ and find values of x where `y'' = 0` $$0 = 6x$$ thus `x = 0`. Substituting `x=0` to `y` yields the point **`(0, 12)`** which is the **point of inflection**.
