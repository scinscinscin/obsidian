**Computer architecture**
 - attributes of a system visible to a programmer
	 - instruction set, number of bits used to represent data types
	 - io mechanisms, techniques for addressing memory
 - has a direct impact on the logical execution of a program
 - Instruction set architecture defines instruction formats, opcodes, registers, instruction and data memory
	 - effect of executed instructions on the registers and memory and an algorithm for controlling instruction execution
**Computer organization**
 - operational units and their interconnections that realize the architectural spec
 - hardware details that are transparent to the programmer
	 - control signals, interfaces between the computer and peripherals and the memory technology used
	 - organizational choices are based on the expected usages of the architecture

A computer is a complex system that can be described using their hierarchical nature
 - a set of interrelated subsystems
 - essential in their design and description since each level consists of a set of components and relationships
 - behavior exists on a simplified abstract characterization of the system at the next lower level
	 - structure - the way components are interrelated
	 - function - operation of each components as part of the structure
 - things that a computer does
	 - data processing - manipulating data 
	 - data storage - the computer must store the data temporarily while they are being worked on at any given moment
		 - short term data storage
		 - long term data storage function
		 - files are stored for retrieval and update
	 - data movement - the operating environment consists of devices that serve as sources or destinations of data
		 - when data is sent / received from a device connected to a computer, it's called input-output, device is referred to as a peripheral
		 - when data is moved over large distances, it's called data communications
	 - control - a control unit manages the computer's resources and orchestrates the performance of its functional parts in response
 - a general purpose computer can do a lot since it's function is decided at the time of programming and not at the time of design
	 - central processing unit - operations of the computer and performs the data processing functions
		 - traditionally, there has been a single processor
			 - multicore computer and each processing unit is called a core
				 - central processing unit - portion that fetches and executes instructions
					 - ALU / CU / registers
				 - core - individual processing unit on a processor chip
					 - equivalent in functionality to a CPU on a single CPU system
					 - specialized processing units may exist, such as one for vector / matrix operations
					 - instruction logic - tasks involved in fetching instructions and decoding each instruction to determine the instruction operation / memory locations of operands
					 - has an ALU
					 - load and store logic - manages the transfer of data to and from main memory via cache
				 - processor - a physical piece of silicon containing one or more cores
					 - computer component that interprets and executes instructions
					 - if it has more than 1 core, it's referred to as a multicore processor
		 - control unit - controls the operations of the CPU and the computer
		 - Arithmetic logic unit - performs the computer's data processing functions
		 - registers - storage internal to the CPU
		 - CPU interconnection - a mechanism that provides communication among the CU / ALU and registers
		 - cache memory - smaller and faster than main memory and is used to speed up memory access by placing the cache data from the main memory
	 - main memory - stores data
	 - i/o - moves data between the computer and the external environment
	 - system interconnection - a mechanism that provides communications among cpu / memory / io
		 - system bus, consisting of conducting wires which all the components attach to each other
		 - most computers are housed in a motherboard
			 - a printed circuit board is a rigid board that holds and interconnects chips and other electronic components
			 - main printed circuit board in a computer is called a system board or motherboard
				 - smaller ones that plug into the slots in the main board are called expansion boards
				 - contains a slot or socket for the processor chip, which contains multiple cores
				 - also has slots for memory chips / io controller chips and other components
				 - expansion slots enable the inclusion of more components on expansion boards
					 - pci-express slots for a display adapter
					 - ethernet controller and ethernet ports for network connections
					 - usb sockets for peripheral devices
					 - SATA sockets for connections to disk memory
					 - interfaces for DDR main memory chips
			 - a chip is a single piece of seminconducting material upon which electronic circuits and logic gates are fabricated
				 - the resulting product is called an integrated circuit
