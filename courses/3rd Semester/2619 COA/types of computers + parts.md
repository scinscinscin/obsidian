Types of computers
 - microcomputers sit on a desk and process data quickly
	 - designed for one user, relatively low, depending on the type / model / features
	 - small businesses / schools and homes
	 - size of components have decreased significantly as well as becoming more cost effective
	 - different types of programs
 - supercomputer
	 - fastest type of computer available
	 - very expensive due to amount of information it needs to process
	 - scientific and engineering tasks such as weather forecasting
	 - calculations on a few programs as quickly as it can
 - mainframe
	 - large / an entire room
	 - hundreds of users and programs without sacrificing performance
	 - large volumes of data an an incredible speed
	 - mainframe computer is accessed whenever you use an atm
	 - centralized systems to and from thin clients / terminals
 - minicomputers
	 - fill part of a room
	 - smaller and process smaller data relative to mainframes
	 - can be used by multiple people at the same time but with reduction of speed
	 - medium sized companies

**software**
 - generic term for collection of computer data and instructions
 - system software - basic non task specific functions of the computer
 - application software - used by users to accomplish specific tasks

Hardware
 - collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer system
 - physical parts of components of a computer such as the monitor / mouse / keyboard all of which are physical objects that can be touched
 - basic blocks of a microcomputer
	 - microprocessor unit
	 - program memory - room
	 - data memory - ram
	 - input and output ports
	 - bus system

CPU
 - responsible for all functions and processes
- most important element
- composed of
	- alu - arithmetic and logical operations like addition subtraction
		- logical operations compare numbers letters or special characters
	- control unit - controls and coordinates computer components
	- registers - stores the data set that is to be executed next
		- very fast storage area
- performs the instruction cycle

RAM
 - memory scheme within the computer system that allows for storing data on a temporary basis
 - accessed by the CPU randomly when needed
	 - must know the memory cell directly if you know the row and column of the cell
 - erased once power supply is turned off
 - processor access the data randomly from the storage

ROM - permanent form of storage that cannot be modified
input devices - peripheral that provides data and control signals
 - translate data from a form that humans understand to one that computers can work with
output devices
 - communicate the results of data processing carried out by a computer by converting electronically generated information into human readable form

Bus system
 - communications pathway used to carry information between various elements of a computer system
 - bus - group of wires in a PCB where binary info is transferred from one part of the computer to another
 - individual systems are connected through an interconnecting bus system
	 - address bus
		 - cpu sends otut the address of memory location to be written / read from
		 - number of address lines dictate the memory locations that the cpu can address
		 - n lines = 2^n locations
	 - data bus
		 - bidirectional data transfer
		 - many devices will have their output connected to the databus but only one device can access at a time
	 - control bus
		 - 4-10 parallel signal lines
		 - cpu sends out signals on the control bus that enable the output of addressed memory or port devices
		 - memory read / memory write / io read / io write
			 - cpu loads the address of the desired byte on the address bus and sends out a memory read signal on the control bus
