 computer instructions 
  - a group of bits that instruct the computer to perform a specific operation
  - divided into parts, each having an interpretation
  - every computer has its own **instruction set**
	  - collection of different instructions that the processor can run
	  - defines the functions of the processor + has a significant effect on the implementation of the processor
	  - programmer's means of controlling the processor
	  - types of instructions:
		  - data processing - arithmetic and logic instructions
		  - data storage - movement of data into or out of register and memory locations
		  - data movement - io instructions
		  - control - test and branch instructions
	  - what an instruction set should include
		  - operation repertoire - number of operations to provide and how complex they should be
			  - data transfer / arithmetic / logical / conversion / io / transfer of control
		  - data types - various types of data that operations can be performed on
		  - instruction format - instruction length in bits
		  - registers - number of processor registers that can be referenced and their used
		  - addressing - modes in which address of an operand can be specified
	  - elements
		  - operation code (opcode) - specifies the operation to be performed
			  - mnemonics that indicate the operation
			  - each symbolic opcode has a fixed binary representation
		  - source operand reference
			  - operation may involve one or more input operands
			  - main or virtual memory
			  - processor register
			  - intermediate
			  - io device
		  - result operand reference
			  - the operation may produce a result
			  - refer to list of possible source operand references
		  - next instruction reference
			  - where to fetch the next instruction after the execution of this instruction is complete

## Addressing Modes

 - technique for specifying the address of the operands
 - Effective address - address where operand is actually found

**types of addressing (example, you can see the addressing modes of 8086 in [[8086]])**
 - immediate addressing mode
	 - operand register is specified within the instruction
		 - `MVI A, 15h` - move the immediate 15 in hex to register A
	 - operand itself is provided within the instruction rather than the address
		 - `ADI 3Eh` - add 3e in hex to the contents of register A
 - register addressing mode
	 - operand is specified within one of the processor register
		 - `mov c, a` - contents of c are moved into A
	 - instruction specifies the register in which the operand is stored
		 - `add b` - add the contents of register B into register A and store it back to A
 - register indirect addressing mode (dereferencing)
	 - specifies the register in which the memory address of operand is placed
	 - does not specify the operand itself but the location in which the operand is placed
		 - `MOV A, M`
	 - basically uses the register as a pointer to the data, "dereferencing" it to find the data it points to
 - direct addressing mode
	 - instruction specifies the address of the operand
	 - memory address is specified where the actual operand is
	 - examples
		 - `LDA 2805h`
			 - load the contents of memory location 2805hex to register A
		 - `STA 2803H`
			 - store the contents of register A into memory location 2803h
 - indirect addressing mode (pointer to pointer)
	 - instruction specifies ethe indirect address where the effective address of the operand is placed
	 - memory address is specified where the actual address of operand is placed
	 - `MOV A, 2802h`
		 - 2802 contains an address that is dereferenced, that value is then stored in A
