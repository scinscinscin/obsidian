 - Good decisions require good information
 - Data is managed most efficiently when stored in a DB
	 - DB evolved from computer file systems
 - Understanding file system characteristics is important

 - Data - raw facts
	 - must be formatted for storage / processing and presentation
	 - is the foundation for information, as building blocks
 - information is the result of processing raw data to reveal meaning
	 - Produced by processing data
	 - Accurate/ relevant / timely information is the key to good decision making
	 - Data management - proper generation / storage and retrieval of data
# Databases
 - solve many problems encountered in data management
 - Used in all modern settings involving data management
 - Shared integrated structure that stores a collection of
	 - End user data - raw facts of interest to end user
	 - Metadata - data about data
		 - Provides description of data characteristics and relationships of data
		 - Complements and expands the value of data
 - **DBMS** - collection of programs that manages the structure and controls access to data
	 - Intermediary between the user and the database
	 - You can only access files through the DBMS
	 - Enables data to be shared
	 - Integrates many users' view of the data (can be used by many different types of users)
	 - Consists of logically related data stored in a single data repository
	 - Most of the functions are transparent to the end-users
	 - transforms data when storing and retrieving data to and from a format that can be understood by computers and humans
	 - 
 - Stores definitions and relationships in a data dictionary
	 - DBMS looks up the required component structures and relationships
	 - Changes are automatically recorded int he dictionary
	 - Provides data abstraction and removes structural and data dependency
 - Advantages
	 - data sharing / security / access / integration
	 - decision making / end user productivity
	 - Minimizes data inconsistencies
 - Classed by
	 - number of users
		 - single user db supports only one user at a time
		 - Multiuser database supports multiple users at the same time
	 - database locations
		 - Centralized db - data is located at a single site
		 - Distributed db - data is distributed across several different sites
	 - expected type and extent of use
		 - Operational database - supports a company's day to day operations
		 - Data warehouse - stores data used for strategic decisions
			 - Unstructured data is stored, meaning they are stored in their original state
 - Types of DB
	 - semi structured data have been processed to some extent
	 - XML represents data elements in textual format

# Database Design
 - focuses on the design of DB structure used for end user data
	 - Designer must identify the expected use of the DB
	 - facilitates data management and generates accurate and valuable information
 - a poorly designed DB causes difficult to trace errors
 - need to study file systems because complexity of database design is easier to understand
	 - understanding file system problems helps to avoid problems with DBMS
	 - useful for converting file systems to database systems
	 - composed of a collection of file folders, where the contents of a folder are logically related
	 - **manual file systems** - a data repository for small data collections
		 - cumbersome for large collections
		 - each file used its own application program to store, retrieve and modify data
		 - each file was owned by an individual or department that commissioned its creation
	 - computerized file systems
		 - converted computer file structure from manual system
		 - wrote software and application programs that managed the data
	 - problems with file systems
		 - security was difficult to program and often omitted in the file system environment
		 - requires extensive programming 
 - **independence**
	 - structural dependence - access to a file is dependent on its own structure
	 - structural dependence - change file structure without affecting data access
	 - data dependence - data access changes when data storage characteristic changes
	 - data independence - data access do not change when the storage characteristic changes
 - logical data format - how humans view data
 - physical data format - how computer must work with data

Data redundancy
 - file system makes it difficult to combine data from multiple sources
 - Organizational structure promotes storage of same data in different locations
	 - islands of information and the data is unlikely to be updated consistently
	 - Data redundancy - same data stored unnecissarily in different places
	 - Data inconsistencies - different and conflicting versions of same data in different places
	 - Data anomalies - all changes in redundant data are not made correctly

## Information system
 - provides data collection / storage and retrieval
 - consists of
	 - Hardware - all the system's physical devices
	 - Software - OS / DBMS / Application programs
	 - People - all users of the database system
	 - Procedures - instructions and rules that govern the design and use of the DB system
	 - Data - collection of facts stored in the database
 - System analysis - processes that establishes need for and extent of information system
 - System development - process of creating information system
 - Uses - transforms data into information that forms basis for decision making
	 - Consists of data and code
 - Performance is tied to
	 - database design and implementation
		 - Creating database storage structure
		 - Loading data into the database
		 - Providing for data management
	 - Application design and implementation
	 - Administrative procedures
 - **SDLC - traces the history of an information system**
	 - Database design and application development is mapped out and evaluated
	 - Planning - initial assessment and feasibility study
		 - Should the existing system be changed?
		 - Evaluate alternate solutions
			 - Technical requirements
			 - System cost and operational cost
	 - Analysis - User requirements / existing system / logical system
		 - Problems defined during planning phase are examined in greater detail during analysis
		 - Thorough audit of the user's requirements

		 - Designer completes the design of system's processes
		 - Includes all necessary specifications
		 - Laid out for conversion from old to new system
	 - Implementation - Coding / testing / debugging / installation / optimization

		 - coding / testing and debugging continues until it is ready for delivery
		 - Database is created and systems is customized
	 - maintenance - Evaluation / Maintenance / Enhancement
		 - Corrective maintenance
		 - adaptive maintenance
		 - Perfective maintenance
 - DBLC
	 - Database initial study
		 - Analyze the situation of the company
		 - Define problems and constraints
		 - Define objectives
		 - Scopes and boundaries
		 - **identifying the information that the user/clients need**
		 - **How information can be accessed and how they should look when they are printed**
		 - **Data definition** - we gather and list all necessarily fields for our database
			 - Think of all data needed
		 - **Data refinement** - breakdown some fields to more specific fields to store information at the smallest logical parts
		 - **Need to tell the database how to bring the original information back by using relationships**
	 - Database design
		 - Concentrate on the data characteristics required to build database model
		 - Two types of views
			 - Business view and Designer's view
	 - implementation and loading
		 - Implement all design specs from previous phase
		 - Install the DBMS
		 - Create the database
		 - Load or Convert the data
	 - Testing and evaluation
		 - In parallel with application programming
		 - DB tools used to prototype apps

	 - Operation
		 - Problems not forseen during testing surface
		 - Load balancing software to distribute transactions among multiple computers
	 - Maintenance and evaluation

**Distributed database design**
 - Portions of database reside in different physical locations
 - Database fragment - subset of a database stored at a given location
 - Processes accessing the database vary from one loc to another
 - Designers must develop data distribution and allocation strategies

**Threats to data security**
 - human error / software failure / hardware failure
 - Theft and fraud
 - Loss of privacy and confidentiality
 - loss of data integrity
 - Loss of availability

Views
 - a subset of the database that is presented to one or more users
 - User can be given privilege to view without allowing access to underlying tables
 - Protect the data from unauthorized use
 - Domains set allowable values

**ACID**
 - Atomic - transaction cannot be subdivided
 - Consistent - constraints don't change from before transaction to after transaction
 - Isolated - DB changes not revealed to users until after transaction has completed
 - Durable - DB changes are permanent
# Data Models
 - simple representations of complex real world data structures
 - model - an abstraction of a real world object or event
	 - useful for understanding complexities of the real world
 - modeling is iterative and progressive
 - importance
	 - facilitates interaction between the programmer / designer and end user
		 - end users have different views and needs for data
	 - data model organizes data for various users
	 - is an abstraction - cannot draw required data out of the data model
 - Building blocks
	 - entity - any object whose data is collected and stored
	 - attribute - a characteristic of an entity
	 - relationship - an association among entities
		 - one to one
		 - many to many
		 - one to many
	 - constraint - a restriction placed on the data
 - business rules - policies / procedures within a specific organization
	 - apply to any organization that stores and uses data to generate information
	 - description of operations to create actions within an org's environment
	 - describes characteristics of data as viewed by the company
 - Nouns -> Entities
 - Verbs -> relationships
 - Models
	 - Hierarchical models
		 - developed in the 1960s to manage large amounts of data for manufacturing projects
		 - basic structure is an upside down tree
		 - structure contains levels or segments
		 - Each parents can have many children, but each child has only one parent
	 - Network mode
		 - represent complex data relationships more effectively than hierarchical model
		 - record may have more than one parent
	 - Relational Model
		 - EF Codd in 1970
		 - Table, is a matrix consisting of row and column intersections
		 - Model was conceptually simple at expense of computer overhead
		 - Stores collection of related identities
		 - SWL-based relational database application involves three parts
			 - End user interface - end user to interact with the data
			 - Set of tables stored in the database
				 - each table is independent from another
				 - Rows in different tables are related using FKs
				 - SQL engine that executes all queries
 - Entity relationship model
	 - Chen in 1976
	 - Graphical representation of entities and their relationships in a database structure
	 - entity relationship diagram
		 - graphic representations to model database components
		 - Entity is mapped to a relational table
		 - Connectivity labels types of relationships
			 - Can be expressed using either Chen notation or Crow's feet
	 - Chen notation
		 - relationships are represented by a diamond, and the relationship name is written inside
	 - Crow's notation
 - Physical model
	 - Operates at lowest level of abstraction
		 - Describes the way that data are saved on storage media such as disk or tapes
		 - Requires definition of physical storage and data access methods
		 - Physical independence - changes in physical model do not affect internal model
