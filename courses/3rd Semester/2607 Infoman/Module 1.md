- how will you analyze data
- databases deal with data analysis

**data** - raw facts
 - there is no thought / indepth understanding
 - becomes information when we process it
	 - cannot analyze something if we don't have data / the data that we have is not enough
 - collected via different methods
 - a building block of information

**database**
 - solves problems encountered in data management
	 -  data management - focuses on proper generation / storage and retrieval of data
	 - business / research / administration
 - it is important to understand how databases work and interact with other applications
 - shared integrated computer structure that stores a collection of
	 - end user data - raw facts of interest to end user
	 - metadata - data about data
		 - data characteristics and relationships in data
		 - components and expands value of data
		 - joined tables
		 - is a filesystem
 - holds / processes / shares the data
 - **types of database**
	 - database can be classified according to
		 - number of users - > 30
		 - locations - where would it be used
		 - expected type and extend of use
	 - single user database supports only one user at a type
		 - desktop database: single user, runs on PC
	 - multiuser database supports multiple users at the same time
		 - workgroup and enterprise databases
	 - centralized database: data located in a single site
	 - distributed database: data is distributed across several different sites
	 - operation database: supports a company's day to day operations
		 - transactional / production database
	 - data warehouse - stores data for tactical or strategic decisions
		 - unstructured data exist in their original state
		 - structured data result from formatting
		 - structure is applied based on type of processing to be performed
 - **why database design is important**
	 - focuses on database structure for end user data
		 - database must identify databases expected use
	 - a well designed database
		 - facilitates data management
		 - generates accurate and valuable information
	 - poorly designed database
		 - difficult to trace errors and poor reports
 - evolution of filesystem data processing

**database management system** - collection of programs
 - manages structures and controls access to data
 - intermediary between the user and the database
	 - database structure stored as a file collection
	 - can only access files through the dbms
 - dbms enables data to be shared
	 - improves data security
	 - better data integration
	 - minimized data inconsistency
	 - decision making
	 - increased end user productivity
 - integrates many user's view of the data
 - the sender and receiver are both end users
