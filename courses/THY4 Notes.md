# History of Spirituality 

- acdg to the catholic church - no spirituality outside of religion
- spiritus - breath of life
	- without the spirit, there is no life, it is the one that animates the body of the person.
	- Death is the separation of the soul from the body, the body has no life
- Religion comes from religio
	- means reliance / connection
	- In spirituality, we find a notion of the spirit in search for connection
- Spirituality - a way of life that searches for God, for what is divine
	- relates to structures of significance that gives meaning and direction to a person's life that helps them deal with existence
	- associated with the human quest for meaning / purpose / knowledge / meaningful relationships / love and a sense of the body
	- no matter your status in life - we strive to find meaning in life, that's why all of us have a connection to spirituality
	- our goals and ambitions motivate us to do certain actions
		- sometimes we base our morality on our goals, if our action leads to the goal, then we might judge our actions as right, vice versa
		- it is important that we should aim to do what is good not only for us but for the entire community
	- the goal of spirituality is to become fully human by building a relationship with god, united with what is divine (the closer we get to god, the more we understand ourselves)
		- Understanding
		- Perseverance
		- Patience
	- aspects of creation
		- matter
		- consciousness / form / soul
	- methods of study
		- science - the study of matter / physical forces that influence matter
		- spirituality - study of consciousness and its evolution / progress
- **Plato**
	- Each human being is a combination of a physical body and a non physical soul. our physical bodies are not really real or important. His ethical theory focuses on the well being of the soul
	- the real things exist only in the world of ideas
		- what we see is a representation and is not important as they are subject to change
		- ideas don't change, which is why his focus was the world of ideas (the non tangible)
	- Justice is harmony between the three different parts of our souls (reason / spirit / appetite), with reason ruling.
		- reason - capable of intellect, pursues truth and knowledge, weakest part but it can governing itself well
			- humans are the only ones that have intellect
			- the brain represents the rational part of the soul, swayed by truths, facts and arguments
		- spirit - the part that is proud and concerned with one's status. it pursues fame and power
			- how feelings fuel our actions - the emotional part
		- appetite - the largest and most powerful part, pursues pleasure and avoids pain.
			- in control of most people's souls, this leads them to many undesirable consequences.
			- drives you to eat, have sex, and protect yourself
			- the animal part of the person
- Origen of Alexandria
	- the ultimate goal of human life is to have a continual communion with god
		- no other goal in life other than to be with God in the future
	- the path to intimacy with god, then is viewed by origen as the soul's journey from earth to heaven
	- body - find god through the five senses
	- soul - find god through enlightened knowledge
	- spirit - find god through perpetual communion with him
		- enter into union with contemplation, resulting in a life of pure love and active charity
- St. Augustine of Hippo
	- spirituality is in inquiry in the supreme good which gives the happiness that all human beings seek
	- This happiness can be found in the enjoyment of God and his presence
	- Criteria of knowing of our actions helps us reach god
		- we need to follow the 10 commandments of god, live a moral life under the guidance of god's commandments, and that is spirituality
		- "if we continue to rely on what god wants us to do, our lives will not perish but it will become joyous instead".
		- It is our duty to follow the will of god because his will is our will too.
			- god cannot suggest something evil for us, he always decides what is good for all of us
	- man has a wounded nature which is outcome of original sin. Everyone has these desires, but each is prone to something different:
		- desire of the flesh
		- desire for wealth and possessions
			- it is not bad, unless you become greedy and corrupt
		- desire for power or authority
	- evangelical counsels
		- allows us to combat the desires present in him through its cultivation and practice
		- with all your soul and chastity - controls our desire of the flesh
		- with all your strength and poverty - desire for wealth or possessions
		- with all your mind and obedience - desire for power or authority
- St. Benedict of Nursia
	- asks us if we truly seek God
	- this is a universal human quest and is central to the whole Benedictine way of life.
	- he considers the ultimate rule of life to be the word of god contained in the scriptures, it's important that we should read, understand, and apply it in our day to day life
		- Ignorance of scriptures is ignorance of christ
		- We have to be familiar with the word of god, since it guides us in our day to day life.
	- Rules
		- Seeking God / the common good / commitment / mutual sharing/ hospitality / care for earth / peace
	- Society
		- seeking material things / individualism / non-involvement / competition / rejection / exploration / violence
	- Obedience is a part of our ongoing conversion, hearing god's word. Listening obedience calls us to be centered again on our seeking for god.
- St. Thomas Aquinas
	- does not separate nature and grace, but rather shows that nature can be used to defend belief in God
	- Reason and the senses can be used by human beings and by doing so, humans can discover truths
	- Summa Theologica Aquinas
		- shows the existence of God in a way that can be demonstrated to be true
		- Tried to disprove the theory of two conflicting truths which spread through the western world under the influence of the writings of the Arabic scholar
		- Uses philosophy to explain theology, logic to make faith reasonable
- The Renaissance
	- the course of western thought changed during the renaissance to a secular direction
		- move towards belief in reason and senses - leading to the emergence of scientific inquiry and the modern era
		- Christianity played in the development of the scientific method. 
		- Christianity was still influential. Vast majority of inventions were still made in a christian context and world view.
	- science has no authority when it comes to spiritual things, only material things
		- This limitation is the reason why we can't limit life to science
	- Human reason as well as nature were now seen as functioning part from religion
		- Secular humanism exalted human reason and experience as the measure of all things instead of God and special revelation
	- God became a less omnipotent spirituality, and spirituality was practised more from a human starting point. 
- **Enlightenment**
	- gained much momentum in the 18th century through French Scholars such as Voltaire and Rousseau
	- these people wanted to promote freedom and equality for all people, based on the idea that a person is actually good and needs to learn to use reason rightly, which they can do with proper education
- **Romanticism**
	- mid 18th century until the mid 19th century. First gained momentum in Germany
	- puts an emphasis in feelings and experience, a focus on the self, a return to nature, a new nationalism and a return to practices / religions / pantheism and mythologies
	- also the time when a strong historicism developed - historian consciousness became widespread among intellectuals
	- the particular became more important then the view of the universal of the enlightenment
		- experience is different from person to person
- Modernism and onwards
	- Hegel developed his idea of dialetical reasoning, being influenced by Romanicism.
		- Claimed that eternal truths do not exist and that different ideas are equially valid. With regard to the concept of spirituality, this would mean that different kinds of spiritualities can co-exist.
	- Darwin - made an important contribution to this context
		- away from the viability and rationality of religion, towards a more naturalistic and evolutionary view
	- Freud - attempted to explain human behaviour entirely on a naturalistic and deterministic basis, without invoking a higher cause
		- Criticized religion as the universal obsessional neurosis of humanity, had a very negative view of religion

 - **Principle of non contradiction** - two opposing ideas can't be true at the same time, since truth is not something you discover
	 - Rene Descartes believes in doubting everything
 - **Spirituality**
	 - Mission without spirituality is like a body without its soul
	 - Spirit / spiritual - the contrast of body and matter

# Spirituality of mercy
 - Internal ecology - environment is for the people
 - Hedonism / throwaway culture

		 - A devotion to pleasure and self-gratification, promoted by advertisements
	 - Must always feel good, pain and suffering should be voided
	 - culprit of destruction
		 - Much harm is done because of hedonism in nature
		 - The way that humanity treats environment influences how it treats itself
		 - Reducing nature to data destroys it
		 - Many laws are not implemented / enforced
	 - Society is invited into hedonism and consumerism regardless of their harmful consequences
 - Throwaway culture
	 - consumes / exploits human life and natural resources
	 - everything is disposable or temporary
		 - not limited to nature: relationships, beliefs, dreams
			 - Human beings are themselves being considered consumer goods to be used and then discarded.
			 - We have created a throwaway culture which is now spreading. It is no longer simply about exploitation and oppression
		 - human beings are being thrownaway even if they have a right to life / dignity and happiness
		 - they are also being excluded, no access or part to society, society is not inclusive (people w/ disabilities are being left behind)
			 - Human beings are creatures of this world, enjoying a right to life, and happiness, and endowed with unique dignity. We cannot fail to consider the effects on people's lives of environmental deterioration, current models of development and the throw away culture
	 - Reduces things to garbage
		 - The earth is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth, in many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish
		 - Contraception / abortion
		 - Abandonment and exclusion
		 - Waste of resources
		 - discarding of relationships, of married love and marriage vows
	 - Account must be taken of the pollution, each year hundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated, much of it non biodegradable, highly toxic and radioactive from homes and businesses
	 - Our industrial system at the end of its cycle of production and consumption, has not developed the capacity to absorb and reuse waste and by-products.
 - Circular Recycling
	 - Take -> make -> consume -> repair -> reuse -> recycle -> make again
 - We change the system to paper from plastic, but we still throwaway the bags, instead of reusing them
 - **Spirituality of mercy**
	 - a spirit filled movement of the heart to be merciful just as god our heavenly father is merciful
	 - Our spirituality arises from own own experience of God's mercy
	 - lives both on the corporal and spiritual works of mercy

	 - Mercy is our vocation as followers of Christ
		 - We must be merciful towards all creation, including the environment
		 - The spiritualty is integral, holistic, and harmonious for it recognizes the kinship with the rest of God's creatures, the rest of God's creation
		 - This vocation is essential to a life of virtue, it's not a secondary aspect of our christian experience
	 - Mercy - the compassion in our hearts for another person's misery, which derives us to do what we can to help him
		 - Affective mercy
			 - An emotion that we feel
			 - We feel pity for those who suffer because we too are subject of such miseries.
			 - Arises from our capacity for empathy
		 - Effective mercy
			 - A position action for the good of another, taking steps to relieve the miseries
			 - Misocondria - having a miserable heart, both affectively and effectively for another person's misery
				 - Has a deeper emotional meaning than a feeling of compassion

				 - the cor - heart is the center of human person and the seat not only of the emotions, but of conscience determination and responsibility
				 - not only a passive emotional compassion but acceptance of active responsibility for the miserable
					 - makes us want to help, and be present where they are needed
				 - does not lament with the evil but seeks to overcome and conquer the evil as much as possible
		 - One must both affective and effective, to be the authentic virtue of mercy
			 - Must be rooted in the right reason - we must do what is the objective good for the other who we seem to help
			 - Proven in effective action for the good of others, as circumstances permit
				 - If we only sympathize without doing anything, the virtue of mercy does not abide in us in any significant degree
		 - Man is much more, being blessed by god with an immortal soul, there is a poverty that goes beyond lack of clothing and food, to a lack of understanding, confusion about how to live and find happiness
		 - Mercy indicates in the direction of gratitude for an unmerited gift and unmerited grace, chesed, which in the hebrew can be used to mean mercy
		 - Everything is revealed in mercy, everything is resolved in the merciful love of the father. It constitutes the existence of the Church. The church must not only be about the spiritual side of healing but aid those in need physically as well.
			 - it requires us to banish indifference and hypocrisy
			 - The culture of care that we have when being merciful is the antidote to the double degradation brought about by the throwaway culture

	 - RA 9275 = Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004

	 - Many are just laws that are not being implemented
	 - Principles make us want to write laws, that should be implemented
		 - Laudato Si wants us to move away from a duty to virtue based ethics
			 - Caring for the environment shouldn't be just a duty that we do, we must do it because it is right, it is what is good, There should be a shift from stewardship to care
			 - One can be a good steward without feeling connected. If one cares, they allow themself to be affected by another so much that their path and priorities change
 - Contemplation
