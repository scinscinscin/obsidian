- subjective history is not necessarily inferior to objective history
- we can't know facts about history from artifacts with 100% certainty
	- they are only a small parts of the history where they belong in, and can only be given historical context if they are placed in a human setting
- a lot of things are not recorded, only a part of what survives attracts the historians
	- the whole history can only be known through the surviving record
- the historian uses their experience to know history from inadequate reminders
	- it can be nothing more than a mental image upon an application of his own experience
	- close to the approx. of truth as he can get, recognizing that the truth is gone
	- he just recreates a verisimilar image of as much of the past as the evidence makes recoverable
- primary source
	- testimony of a witness of anyone that was present at the events they tell (eyewitness)
	- they only need to be original - first hand as to their testimony
		- original source and primary source are different
- secondary source - someone who is not an eyewitness
- History
	- Greek for historia - learning / inquiry
	- Germans - Gerschichte - to happen
	- Chronological record of significant record events, study of past
- kasaysayan
	- narrative / relevance / importance
	- the inquiry conducted by the historian and the series of past events into which he inqueries
	- interaction between historian and facts, and their interpretation
- Historical method
	- historians have to verify sources, date them, locate place of origin
	- process of critically examining and analyzing the records and survivals of the past
	- "Each generation of historians develops its own perspective, our understanding of the past is constantly reshaped by the historian and the world where they live in"
		- Howell and Prevenier
	- Events observed by someone > events observed and remembered > events recorded > those that have surviving records > believable records for a historical account > the historian's cone of view.
		- the information we get is pretty small, our lives are small compared to our own past
- Historical sources
	- materials used for the writing of history
	- products of their own times
	- sometimes, they are dubious sources, must be keen in verification
	- Primary sources
		- provides us with eyewitness account of what happened
		- it is an important asset in recovering / recreating our past
	- secondary sources
		- academic journals / books / the things that we read
		- are summaries - has a different interpretation since the people who wrote it are detached from the event
			- is balanced with different primary sources
		- has some room for questioning
			- point of view of the author - maybe the author has an agenda
		- may have pictures, quotes, or graphics of the primary sources in them so the people have more appreciation
	- other classifications
		- written / non written source
			- Non written: oral / artifact / ruins / fossils / art works / videorecordings / audiorecordings
		- published / unpublished

			 - Datu was chiefs in war, leader of the barrangay, corresponds to knights
		 - Pre-colonial class divide / **social stratification** (classified by Plasencia)
			 - Kadatuan - The Datu and his family
				 - Becomes datu since they have support and allegiance from the Timawa
				 - The power is not tied to land since land is abundant but more so sa dami ng timawa na sumusuporta
